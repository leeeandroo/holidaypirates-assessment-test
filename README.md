This test requires knowledge in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. You are free to choose whatever framework, library, preprocessor ... you like - or none at all. Attached mockups could be seen as a guideline to how the result should look.

If there are open questions, choose the most reasonable answers for yourself. Should there be problems with the API endpoint, contact us with a detailed bug description.

#The task

Implement a search result list for hotels

###Description

- When the user clicks the „Load hotels“ button, the data of five hotels should be received from the API endpoint with an AJAX call.
- If the request was successful, show a list of hotels like in the mockup
- If not, show an appropriate error message
- When the user clicks on a „Show reviews“ button, the reviews should be loaded for this specific hotel.
- Show the reviews in a list below the hotel information, but inside the hotel item container.

###API endpoint

To provide you with required data, we set up a fake hotel server that generates random hotels and reviews. All needed documentation is published on http://fake-hotel-api.herokuapp.com/ .

###Additional requirements

Should run without errors on current versions of Firefox, Chrome and Safari, plus Internet Explorer 10 and above. HTML should be valid for current HTML5 standards. Responsive behavior is not requested, but feel free to be creative!
